# Genetic-Diseases-Analysis-website
Genetic diseases are caused by abnormalities in an individual's DNA.
These diseases can be inherited or acquired and can affect any part of the body.
With the rise of genomics, there has been a growing need for tools to analyze genetic data. 
The Genetic Diseases Analysis website is one such tool that allows users to query information about various diseases through their names, types, and associated genes.
The website is built on Django and uses a MongoDB database that includes collections for diseases, genes, genes_to_uniprot, and proteins.
# Data Source
Our database is collected from DisGeNET,
DisGeNET is a publicly available database that integrates information on human genes and genetic diseases from various sources.
It provides a comprehensive resource for researchers to explore the genetic basis of human diseases and to identify potential therapeutic targets.
